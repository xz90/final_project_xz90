# Final Project Proposal
### Xingjian Zhang (NetID: xz90)


1. **What Project I want to do**
   1. Make creative coding using particles. [Sample: [Cinder Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx3hTgrOyFg)]
   1. Use external library to detect people's face and re-constructit using many particles
   1. Design effects that people's faces are "disappearing"[People disappeared at the end of movie *Avengers*: [Effect Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFomwoVngOI)]
   1. Make it people's face movable and the program can detect it continuously (Using *OpenCV*)


2. **What Background do I have**
   1. Basic Cinder implementation ability 
   1. Can code in C++
  
    

3. **Why do I want to do this Project**
    1. The disappearing effect is cool for me
    1. I think creative coding is very interesting
    1. Have experiences about designing particles


4. **Timeline**
    1. By the end of Week1, I will have implemented particles based on human faces
    1. By the end of Week2, I will have implemented special effects and start working on connect it with OpenCV functions
    1. By the end of Week3, I will have implemented OpenCV functions and make the whole project runnable


5. **Stretch Goals**
    1. Different colors/sizes of particles
    1. Time complexity of algorithms
    1. Make other objects into particle-shape (*Like chairs, books, cats, etc.*)
   
 
6. **External Libraries**
    1. Cinder OpenCV to detect human face
    1. Cinder Geometry Geometric functions to make the particle effects
